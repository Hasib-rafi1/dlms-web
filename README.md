# Distributed Library Management System (DLMS) using Java Web Service
CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY | DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING | Assignment 3 | COMP 6231, Winter 2019 |Distributed Library Management System (DLMS) using web Service

This is the webservice implimentation of the previous assignment. and all the infomrmation of project description is from the first assignment.

First assignment : https://github.com/Hasib-rafi1/dlms
Second assignment : https://github.com/Hasib-rafi1/dlms-corba


In  this  assignment,  you  are  going  to  implement  the  Distributed  Library  Management  System  (DLMS)  from Assignment 2 as a web service. Specifically, design the service from Assignment 2 (using the same functions and exceptions) by doing the following: 

•Extract  the  Java  client-server  implementation  by  removing  the  CORBA  specific  code from your Assignment 2. 

•Properly annotate your Java implementation to adapt it as a web service.  

•Build the end point files using the wsgencommand before publishing the service.  

•Import the wsdl files using the wsimportcommand.

Your  server  design  should  maximize  the  concurrency  in  the  application.  In  other  words,  use proper synchronization that allows multiple users/managers   perform the operations at the same time.
